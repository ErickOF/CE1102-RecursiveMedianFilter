This practical work aims to introduce the student to the process of analysis, design, and implementation of an object-oriented software system, using list recursion and basic concepts of matrix manipulation.

## **Part I**

### **Motivation**

Modern electronic and computer systems receive data from various types of sensors from the real world. It is common to implement systems with sensors of various types, such as radiofrequency sensors, infrared sensors used in telecommunications, and more sophisticated sensors like digital cameras.

A frequent problem that modern digital system designers face is noise. Since sensors are directly exposed to the environment to measure different physical magnitudes (light, electromagnetic waves, force, etc.), they often end up "perceiving" distortions in the sensed signal for various reasons. These include thermal noise affecting the most sensitive electronic components, difficult signal conditions (low amplitude of the physical magnitude to be measured, interference from other signals, etc.), among many others. There are various types of noise, one of the most studied in the literature is impulsive noise or "salt and pepper" noise. This type of noise occurs when there is information loss in the transmission of digital images or failures of electronic devices that convert the analog signal of each light sensor in the camera sensor array into a digital value. Figure 1 shows an image affected by this type of noise.

There are other types of noise, such as Gaussian noise or "speckle" noise, which is very common in images taken by synthetic aperture radars (SAR), used to sense different types of terrestrial objects (water bodies, vegetation, constructions, etc.). An example image taken by a SAR is shown in Figure 2.

## **Part II**

### **Noise Attenuation with a Digital Filter**

For this practical work, you are proposed to design a program that eliminates or at least attenuates the effect of impulsive noise mentioned in the previous section. To do this, the program will implement the concept of a digital filter, which consists of modifying the original signal by "filtering" or removing image attributes that possibly correspond to elements associated with noise, and therefore, are undesired. The program will receive grayscale images, i.e., with each pixel value in the range [0-255]. The suggested approach to implement the digital filter is based on the concept that inspires a whole family of filters called rank-order filters. Such filters go through each pixel in the image and analyze a neighborhood or window for each.

In the image in Figure 3, a $3 \times 3$ pixel window is defined for the pixel with a value of 6. Rank-order filters propose taking all the pixels in each window, sorting them in ascending order, and then taking the "middle" value as the new value of the output image, which is statistically referred to as the median. Thus, the output image will be reconstructed from the medians of all the windows defined for each pixel of the input image. The filtering algorithm will receive the grayscale image to be filtered and the size of the neighborhood or window to be examined for each pixel in the image. To sort the pixels in the image, it is proposed to research and implement at least one sorting algorithm based on recursion.

You are not allowed to take code directly from the internet or call external libraries to sort the pixels or filter the image.

An example of the median filtering output is shown in Figure 4.

## **Part III**

### **Program Requirements**

The program must be developed in Python, using the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, and must meet the following functional requirements:

1. Ask the user for the path and name of the input image, as well as the path where the processed image (output) will be saved.
2. Ask the user for the width of the window to be used.

Optionally, the program can:

1. Implement additional sorting algorithms based on recursion (tail, stack, or simple recursion) according to prior research.
2. Display the filtering operation execution time in milliseconds (ms) to the user.
